Everything is an email

This is a thought that's been kicking around in my head but was finally given
life by Jes Olson's
["email is good actually"](https://j3s.sh/thought/email-is-good-actually.html).
Email got the important parts right, but it's old and crufty, and we want more
out of it now. It seems prudent, then, to heed
[Gall's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law) and
try to evolve the existing, simple (successful) system that is email into what
we want, rather than trying to design a complex system from scratch.

Watch this space. More coming soon.
